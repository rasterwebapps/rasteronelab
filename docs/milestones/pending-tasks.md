### 🟡 P1 — Required for Phase 2 Closure

#### TASK-P2-08 · Add frontend unit tests for critical admin components

**Issue:** 0 `.spec.ts` files exist for 42 frontend components.

**Work required (minimum viable coverage — highest-risk components):**
- [ ] `branch-list.component.spec.ts` — test data table, search, pagination
- [ ] `branch-form.component.spec.ts` — test form validation, create/edit flows
- [ ] `test-master-list.component.spec.ts` — test filters, data binding
- [ ] `test-master-form.component.spec.ts` — test parameter assignment
- [ ] `user-list.component.spec.ts` — test role/branch display
- [ ] `user-form.component.spec.ts` — test Keycloak role integration
- [ ] `role-list.component.spec.ts` — test permission matrix rendering

---

#### ✅ TASK-P2-07 · Backend test coverage ≥80% — RESOLVED (PR #15)

21 of 26 services now have unit tests = **81%** (target 80% met).
Services still without tests: AntibioticOrganismMappingService, AutoValidationRuleService, DeltaCheckConfigService, HolidayService, MicroorganismService.

---

### 🟢 P2 — Nice to Have (Should Complete Before Phase 3 Sign-off)

#### TASK-P2-09 · Add OpenAPI `@Operation` annotations to all 26 controllers

**Issue:** SpringDoc is configured and auto-generates from code, but no `@Tag`, `@Operation`, or `@ApiResponse` annotations provide human-readable documentation.

**Work required:**
- [ ] Add `@Tag(name = "...", description = "...")` on each controller class
- [ ] Add `@Operation(summary = "...", description = "...")` on each endpoint method
- [ ] Add `@ApiResponse` for common status codes (200, 400, 404, 409)
- [ ] Add example request/response bodies via `@Schema` on DTOs

---

#### TASK-P2-10 · Implement branch provisioning wizard

**Issue:** LIS-029. There is no guided multi-step dialog for setting up a new branch (working hours, departments, number series).

**Work required:**
- [ ] Multi-step Angular Material `MatStepper` dialog component
- [ ] Step 1: Branch basic info (name, code, type, address)
- [ ] Step 2: Assign departments (checkbox list from org departments)
- [ ] Step 3: Configure working hours (reuse `working-hours-form`)
- [ ] Step 4: Set number series prefixes per document type
- [ ] Confirmation step with summary

---

#### TASK-P2-11 · Verify reference range overlap validation

**Issue:** LIS-021. Overlapping age/gender reference ranges for the same parameter should be rejected.

**Work required:**
- [ ] Review `ReferenceRangeService.create()` for overlap check
- [ ] If missing: add validation that no two ranges for the same `parameterId` + `gender` overlap in age range
- [ ] Add unit test covering overlap scenario

---

#### TASK-P2-12 · Verify branch override pricing logic in `PriceCatalogService`

**Issue:** LIS-023. Branch-level price overrides (branch price takes precedence over org-level price) should be verified.

**Work required:**
- [ ] Review `PriceCatalogService` for branch override logic
- [ ] If missing: implement price resolution order (branch → org → default)
- [ ] Add unit test: branch price overrides org price for same test

---

## 🟡 Phase 3 — Patient & Ordering (~65% — Critical domain logic remaining)

> **Context (as of 2026-03-19):** lis-patient, lis-order, lis-billing backend CRUD is fully implemented; all 3 frontend modules have inline-template components (PR #17); all 7 Phase 3 controllers have OpenAPI annotations (PR #17); DB migrations are complete.

#### TASK-P3-02 · LIS-035: Duplicate Patient Detection and Merge

- [ ] Duplicate detection: name + DOB match, phone match (weighted scoring algorithm) — entity exists, algorithm missing
- [ ] `PatientMergeService`: select primary patient, transfer orders/results to primary, deactivate duplicate
- [ ] Merge audit trail: log which records were merged and by whom
- [ ] Endpoints: `GET /api/v1/patients/duplicates`, `POST /api/v1/patients/merge`
- [ ] Integration tests for merge scenarios

---

- [ ] Wire `BarcodeGeneratorUtil.generateOrderNumber()` in `TestOrderService.create()` (field exists, util not called)
- [ ] Panel expansion: expand TestPanel → constituent OrderLineItems by tube type
- [ ] Unit tests for each state transition

---

#### TASK-P3-06 · LIS-039: Order Validation and Sample Requirements

### Cross-Cutting (Phase 3)

#### TASK-P3-16 · LIS-049: Spring Events for Order → Invoice auto-generation

Events classes exist in `lis-core` (`OrderPlacedEvent`, `OrderCancelledEvent`, `PaymentReceivedEvent`) but nothing publishes them yet.

- [ ] Call `publishEvent(new OrderPlacedEvent(...))` in `TestOrderService.placeOrder()`
- [ ] `InvoiceService` `@EventListener` for `OrderPlacedEvent` → auto-generate invoice

  4. Record payment (full CASH) → assert invoice status `PAID`, order status `PAID`
- [ ] Partial payment test (split CASH + UPI)
- [ ] Multi-branch isolation test (orders from branch A not visible from branch B)
- [ ] Error scenarios: duplicate patient, cancelled order, refund flow

---

#### ✅ TASK-P3-20 · OpenAPI documentation for Phase 3 APIs — RESOLVED (PR #17)
`@Tag`, `@Operation`, `@ApiResponse`, `@Parameter` annotations added to all 7 Phase 3 controllers (PatientController, PatientVisitController, TestOrderController, InvoiceController, PaymentController, RefundController, CreditAccountController).
